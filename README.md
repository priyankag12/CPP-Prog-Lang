C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that's widely used in various applications, from system software to high-performance applications, games, and more.

### Compiled Language:
C++ is a compiled language, meaning that source code is written in text files and then compiled into machine code (binary format) that the computer can execute directly.
### Object-Oriented: 
C++ supports object-oriented programming (OOP), allowing developers to organize code into classes and objects. This approach promotes code reusability, modularity, and easier maintenance.
### Syntax: 
The syntax of C++ is derived from its predecessor, C, with additional features introduced to support OOP. It includes features such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, templates, and more.
### Standard Library: 
C++ comes with a rich standard library that provides a wide range of functions and classes for various tasks, including input/output operations, data structures, algorithms, and more.
